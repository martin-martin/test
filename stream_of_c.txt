ments in-between things happening are when you are the most aware, when you can think clearly and observe others as only you.  How to write about these moments but still have a plot? I think that would make this an interesting story. Somehow we have to show the reader what is going on (plot) by only talking about what happens between what is actually happening... does that make sense? I think it might be really interesting and I think this narrator is well suited to describe such situations

An event that is behind everything but never really comes - she’s in the place because she wants/needs to be... taking care of someone, or for a task.
So the situation should go abcd and it does, in a sense go abcd but the a b c and d are inert landmarks in the background. 

Interesting… I like this. 


Relationships with people she isn’t connected to, superficial interactions with people she is? 
 
Takes place in the current time and in our world, but she’s an outsider to that world and lives in a (very?) different one (think HP or Murakami) 


character is lonely 
with people struggling to connect 
people moving she’s staying 
inner dialogue and descriptive
paradoxical = connected to people she doesn't talk to, not connected to people she talks to 
  
I want the names to be like car names - lexus or acura - that are almost really words/names that aren’t.
