(6/27/16 *) How to be connected to people she doesn’t talk to
Internal dialogue (like a crazy person?)
Making up stories about people she sees on the street
Exchanging gifts with someone sight unseen (think Boo Radley leaving chewing gum in the tree with the hole in it)


How to disconnect from people she talks to
unobservant and always distracted and carrying out an internal dialogue

(6/27/16 @) i think also involving herself in whatever tasks or interactions those people are participating in - feeling part of a conversation, relating to them, having an idea about how to help them with what they are doing, or a better way to do it. I like the gift idea... having an exchange with an unknown person. The thing on her hotel door could be part of that

internal dialogue yes for people she is talking to - sort of random descriptions of things in the middle of a conversation (sneakers, coffee being put down, other people, architecture, noises, whatever)

(6/27/16 *) "paradoxical = connected to people she doesn't talk to, not connected to people she talks to" like that person Charles?

(6/27/16 @) yes and ask the girls by the printer - i think she might have had the strongest connection with them

(6/27/16 *) When I read through this story, I sometimes get the impression that the main character is a guy 

(6/27/16 @) Veryyyyy interesting. Let’s keep it ambiguous. We could easily write an entire story without mentioning gender.
